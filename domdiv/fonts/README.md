#### Fonts
I believe I cannot distribute one font (Minion Pro) domdiv uses as they are commercially sold by Adobe. However, the font files are included with every install of the free Adobe Reader. For example, on Windows 7 they are in C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 9.0\Resource\Font called `MinionPro-Regular.otf`, `MinionPro-Bold.otf` and `MinionPro-It.otf`.

Sadly, these fonts use features of the otf format that are not support by the reportlab package. Thus, they need to first be converted to ttf (TrueType) format. I used the open source package fontforge to do the conversion. Included as 'convert.ff' is a script for fontforge to do the conversion, on Mac OS X with fontforge installed through macports you can just run `./convert.ff MinionPro-Regular.otf`, `./convert.ff MinionPro-Bold.otf` and `./convert.ff MinionPro-It.otf`. With other fontforge installations, you'll need to change the first line of convert.ff to point to your fontforge executable. I have not done this step under Windows - I imagine it may be possible with a cygwin install of fontforge or some such method. Copy these converted files to this subdirectory.
